I am Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Kent working in the EPSRC project 'Modelling removal and re-introduction data for improved conservation' with Dr Rachel McCrea. My research interests include
- Spatial and spatiotemporal models applied to species distribution.
- Understanding effects and causality of environmental disturbances such as forest fires, pests, pollutants and climate change.
- Applications of statistics in environmental science, conservation.

All of my papers can be found on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kttZf6oAAAAJ&hl=en).


### Bio sketch
I have made major contributions to the understanding of computationally efficient methods in spatial statistics, and of how to specify prior distributions for complex Bayesian models. I have been a maintainer and developer on both the [R-INLA](http://r-inla.org/) and [Stan](http://mc-stan.org/) projects, which are widely used open source software projects popular in the applied statistics and scientific communities. I have also been a member of Stanâ€™s leadership bodies, first the NumFOCUS board and then the Stan Governing Board that grew out from it.

Prior to my commencement at the University of Kent, I have spent most of the time in industry as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst. I developed my PhD studies at the University of Valencia (Spain) (https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/tesis?codigo=212822). Previously I study a MSc in Biostatistics at the Univeristy of Valencia (Spain) and a BEng in Forest Engineering at the University of Oviedo (Spain).
