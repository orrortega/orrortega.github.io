I am Statistical Ecologist working as a Lecturer in Statistics at the University of Kent. My research involves the deveopment and use of complex spatio‐temporal statistical models, geographic information systems (GIS), and working collaboratively in a multi‐disciplinary environment.

My research interests include:

- Spatial and spatio temporal models applied to species distribution.
- Understanding effects and causality of environmental disturbances such as forest fires, pests, pollutants and climate change.
- Applications of statistics in environmental science and conservation.

All of my papers can be found on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kttZf6oAAAAJ&hl=en).


### Bio sketch

Since June 2019, I am working at the University of Kent first as a Postdoctoral Researcher in Statistics, at the Statistical Ecology group and since 2021 as Lecturer in Statistics (temporary contract - teaching focus).

Between 2013 and 2018, I did my PhD in Statistics at the School of Mathematics of the University of Valencia, under the supervision of Antonio Lopez-Quilez and Marta Blangiardo. I worked on Spatio Temporal models of Species distribution. My thesis is available online: Spacio temporal modeling of species distribution.

In 2013, I finished a MSc in Biostatistics at the University of Valencia doing my dissertation in species distribution models with forest trees species. In 2010 I graduated in BEng in Forest Engineering at the University of Oviedo, I focused my dissertation in nocturnal Lepidoptera. The thesis is available online (sorry only Spanish version): Nocturnal Lepidoptera inventory of Atlantic Islands National Park (Cíes, Ons, Sálvora y Cortegada) (Galicia, Spain). 

I worked in industry at the same time I was doing my PhD working as Data analyst and Data Scientist. Previously, I worked as forest engineer in several positions not only in academia (I've worked as Research assistant in Entomology at the Polytechnic University of Madrid), but also I have experience in field working on several positions such as technician in forest fires, inventories or project manager in the project: "cultivation of fruit trees in rainfed areas in northern Morocco".
