I am Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Kent working in the EPSRC project 'Modelling removal and re-introduction data for improved conservation' with Dr Rachel McCrea. My research interests include
- Spatial and spatio temporal models applied to species distribution.
- Understanding effects and causality of environmental disturbances such as forest fires, pests, pollutants and climate change.
- Applications of statistics in environmental science and conservation.

All of my papers can be found on my [Google Scholar page](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=kttZf6oAAAAJ&hl=en).


### Bio sketch

I developed my PhD studies at the University of Valencia (Spain). Previously I studed a MSc in Biostatistics at the University of Valencia (Spain) and a BEng in Forest Engineering at the University of Oviedo (Spain).

During my Degree Thesis, titled "Nocturnal Lepidoptera inventory of Atlantic Islands National Park (Cíes, Ons, Sálvora y Cortegada) (Galicia, Spain)", I started to have interest in analyse ecological data through a Statistical approach, for that reason I enrolled the MSc in Biostatistics at the University of Valencia. At the begining of my PhD I realised the interest of spatial and spatio temporal models to understand species distribution models, being one of my current interests and passions.

Prior to my commencement at the University of Kent, I have spent most of the time in industry as a Data Scientist and Data Analyst. However, not only I have worked "behind the desk", but also I have done several field work. I have worked in entomological and amphibians and reptiles inventories, environmental flow regimes, forest health, crop management, etc.
