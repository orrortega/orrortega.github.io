<b>Spatial and spatio-temporal models to understand ecological processes (Oct-2019). University of Leeds.
---
Climatic change is expected to affect forest development in the short term, as well as the spatial distribution of species in the long term. The aim of this presentation is to study ecological processes from different perspectives and to analyse the different approaches to this problem. We apply spatio-temporal models based on Gaussian processes, which have been successfully applied in other disciplines. In order to fit the Bayesian model, instead of the common Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method, we have used the novel integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA), through the Stochastic Partial Differential Equation (SPDE) approach. This approach can be easily implemented, providing good results with less computation than MCMC. This model can be expanded to the spatio-temporal domain, including new parameters that reflect linear, nonlinear, autoregressive or more complex behaviours. Bayesian approach shows more flexibility, and the inclusion of the spatial field or the latent spatio-temporal process allows including residuals as a proxy for unmeasured variables. Spatial and spatio-temporal Bayesian models are a really interesting approach for the understanding of environmental dynamics, not only because of the possibility to develop and solve more complex problems but also because of the transparent implementation.
